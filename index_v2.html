    <h1>Welcome to the Velvet Side Speakeasy</h1>
    <p>Here we do all of our tastings in a blind flight of 3 or 4 bottles to ensure there is no influence or bias to our tasting notes.</p>
    <p>Couple of things to note about our tastings.  We have three sensory categories to judge each whiskey by; nose, palate, and finish on a scale of 1 to 10.  Our final score for the bottle is weighted 30% of the mose score, 50% of the palate score and 20% of the finish score.</p>
    <p>We also category our bottles by proof; flyweight (80.0 - 89.9 proof), lightweight (90.0 - 99.9 proof), middleweight (100.0 - 101.9 proof), cruiserweight (102.0 - 110.9 proof) and heavyweight (111.0+ proof)</p>
    <p>The compass in the top right corner is a navigation tool to help you find a bottle that you think you may like; between the 3 sensory categories and 5 weight classes, there are 15 navigation buttons to select from.</p>
    <p>We hope you find a bottle you like!</p>
