    <h1>Welcome to the Velvet Side Speakeasy</h1>
    <p>Our tastings are experienced in blind flights of 3 or 4 bottles.  We like to ensure there is no influence or any existing bias regarding the labels of the bottles we are tasting.</p>
    <p>Couple of other details about our blind tasting flights.  We have three (3) sensory categories to evaluate each bottle; nose, palate, and finish. We score each sensory on a scale of 1 to 10 and our final score for the bottle is weighted by 30% for the nose score, 50% of the palate score and 20% of the finish score.  We will often times use [[note]] to emphasis the most dominate and strongest note within that sensory.</p>
    <p>The five primary proof categories we use are; flyweight (80.0 - 89.9 proof), lightweight (90.0 - 99.9 proof), middleweight (100.0 - 101.9 proof), cruiserweight (102.0 - 110.9 proof) and heavyweight (111.0+ proof)</p>
    <p>We hope you find a bottle you like and would love to hear your feeback!  Remember, enjoy your own personal whiskey journey ... and be sure to share that journey with close family and close friends. Cheers!</p>
