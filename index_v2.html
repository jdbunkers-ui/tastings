    <h1>Welcome to the Velvet Side Speakeasy</h1>
    <p>Our tastings are all performed in a blind flight of 3 or 4 bottles to ensure there is no influence or any existing bias regarding the labels on the bottle.</p>
    <p>Couple of things to know about our tastings.  We have three (3) sensory categories to evaluate each bottle; nose, palate, and finish and we score each sensory on a scale of 1 to 10.  Our final score for the bottle is weighted 30% for the nose score, 50% for the palate score and 20% for the finish score.</p>
    <p>We have also categorzied our bottles by proof; flyweight (80.0 - 89.9 proof), lightweight (90.0 - 99.9 proof), middleweight (100.0 - 101.9 proof), cruiserweight (102.0 - 110.9 proof) and heavyweight (111.0+ proof)</p>
    <p>We also encourage you to use the navigational compass in the top right hand corner.  It contains 15 categories; an intersection of the three sensory categories and the 5 weight classes.</p>
    <p>We hope you not only find a bottle you like, but would love to hear your feeback!  Remember, enjoy your whiskey journey..and that journey is best shared with close family and friends.</p>
